- Follow PostgreSQL and Drizzle best practices for security and performance.
- Use Zod schemas to validate data exchanged with the backend.
- Use database client from `src/db/client.ts` and Lucia auth from `src/lib/auth.ts`
- Implement Row Level Security through application-level access control with Drizzle queries
